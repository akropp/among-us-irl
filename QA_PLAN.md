## Introduction

This QA Plan outlines the testing approach for the Among Us IRL platform, encompassing all three major components:
- Game Server (Node.js/Express)
- Admin Console (React)
- Player Console (React)

The primary goals of this QA plan are to:
- Ensure the quality and reliability of all system components
- Validate that the application meets functional requirements
- Verify that the platform provides an excellent user experience
- Identify and address defects before release

## Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions and classes in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests interactions between different components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Tests complete user flows across the entire platform
4. **Manual Testing**: Human-verified tests focusing on user experience
5. **Performance Testing**: Tests system performance under load
6. **Security Testing**: Tests system resilience against common security threats

## Types of Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Game Server**: Jest tests for controllers, models, and services
- **Admin Console**: React Testing Library for components and context tests
- **Player Console**: React Testing Library for components and context tests

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint tests using Jest and Supertest
- Socket.io communication tests
- Database interaction tests

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete game flow tests using Cypress
- Cross-device testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Manual Testing
- User experience validation
- Real-world game session testing
- Exploratory testing

### Performance Testing
- Socket connection load testing
- Database performance testing
- Server response time testing

### Security Testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing
- Session management testing

## Testing Environment

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- MongoDB running locally or in Docker
- Node.js v18+

### Testing Environment
- Testing server with all components
- Dedicated test MongoDB instance
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions)

### Staging Environment
- Mirror of production setup
- Isolated database
- Similar hardware specifications to production

### Production Environment
- Live deployment environment
- Production database
- Monitored for performance and availability

## Test Cases

2. Game creation and management
3. Player joining and leaving games
4. Task assignment and completion
5. Emergency meeting and voting
6. Game state management
7. Real-time communication
8. Home Assistant integration

### Admin Console Test Cases
1. Admin authentication
2. Game creation and configuration
3. Game monitoring and management
4. Player management
5. Map and location configuration
6. Task creation and editing
7. Game statistics and reporting

### Player Console Test Cases
1. Game joining
2. Task visualization and completion
3. Map navigation
4. Emergency meetings
5. Communication features
6. Role-specific actions (Impostor/Crewmate)
7. Mobile responsiveness
8. Visual effects and feedback

## Bug Reporting Process

### Bug Classification
- **Critical**: Prevents game functionality, affects all users
- **Major**: Significant impact on users, but has workarounds
- **Minor**: Limited impact on users, cosmetic issues
- **Enhancement**: Suggestions for improvement

### Bug Reporting Template
- **Title**: Concise description of the issue
- **Environment**: Device, browser, OS details
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to recreate the issue
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Screenshots/Recordings**: Visual evidence if applicable
- **Severity**: Critical, Major, Minor, or Enhancement

### Bug Tracking
All bugs will be tracked in GitHub Issues with appropriate labels and milestones.
